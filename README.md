# college_project
This project is under the banner of web development. We have developed a mentoring website in which both students and mentors can register themselves.
There is a seperate mentor section where mentors can register and fill their details which can be seen by the interested students who want to get
mentored. Blogging section is also implemented where users can upload their blogs and share their views.
